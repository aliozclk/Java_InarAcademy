How would you write the following arithmetic expression in Java?
a. 
b.
......................

a..  4.0 / (3 * (r + 34)) - 9.0 * (a + b * c) + (3 + d * (2 + a) )/ (a + b * d)

b..  5.5 * Math.pow(r + 2.5, 2.5 + t)

How do you obtain the current second, minute, and hour?
..........................

long totalMills = System.currentTimeMillis() returns the milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970.
long totalSeconds = totalMills / 1000 returns the total seconds.
long totalMinutes = totalSeconds / 60 returns the total minutes.
totalSeconds % 60 returns the current second.
totalMinutes % 60 returns the current minute.
totalMinutes / 60 % 24 returns the current hour.

.....
yes, can be used via casting.

What does an explicit casting from a double to an int do with the fractional part of
the double value? Does casting change the variable being cast?
...................
(int) double value

The fractional part is truncated.

2.35 What is an integer overflow? Can floating-point operations cause overflow?
.........................

Numbers are stored with a limited numbers of digits. When a variable is assigned a value that is too large (in size) to be stored, 
it causes overflow. Overflow is for integer operations. Floating-point operations will not cause overflow.

__________________________________________________________________________

 2.36 Will overflow cause a runtime error?

No. It is a logic error.

2.37 What is a round-off error? Can integer operations cause round-off errors? Can
floating-point operations cause round-off errors?
.......

A round-off error, also called a rounding error, is the difference between the calculated approximation of a number and its exact mathematical value.
 Integer operations will not cause rounding error. Floating-point operations may cause rounding error.
