Translate the following algorithm into Java code:
Step 1: Declare a double variable named miles with initial value 100.
Step 2: Declare a double constant named KILOMETERS_PER_MILE with value
1.609.
Step 3: Declare a double variable named kilometers, multiply miles and
KILOMETERS_PER_MILE, and assign the result to kilometers.
Step 4: Display kilometers to the console.
What is kilometers after Step 4?

double miles = 100 ;
final double KILOMETERS_PER_MILE = 1.609 ;
double kilometers = miles *  KILOMETERS_PER_MILE ;
System.out.println(kilometers) ;

Kilometers is 160,9
