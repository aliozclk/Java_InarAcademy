2.2 How do you write a statement to let the user enter a double value from the keyboard?

What happens if you entered 5a when executing the following code?
double radius = input.nextDouble();

Answer :

Scanner input = new Scanner (System.in);
double value = input.nextDouble();

if you entered 5a when executing this code, it will give a runtime error.
Because "double"type cannot hold "char" or "String" type.
